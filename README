** VAWisWOW **
This is the poster I present at Evolution 2018, Montpellier.
The poster itself is the file VAWisWOW.pdf and was created by pdfLaTeX applied on the file VAWisWOW.tex with the very ad-hoc and messy style file fancytikzposterM.sty and a few other dependencies. 

It is a mess indeed, but I hope everything is online for you to recompile the poster and analyse the LaTeX code if you want.

Some of the illustrations were produced in R (see Rgraph/Rgraph.Rnw and Rgraph/maping.R) and in LaTeX (backtransformation.tex). No promises the version online is correct. 

I cannot share all of the code at this stage because the research presented here is in progress, and I cannot share the raw data at all because they belong to several research groups.
